# CRUD-FRS-with-Java-native

This project is only for completing the final project in the middle of Semester 3.
I give the name MyFRS because this app is simple about student FRS CRUD.

In working on this project I used the IntelliJ IDE Community Edition 2020.2.2 application.
And for the Development Kit I use Oracle JDK-15.

In this project, there are 5 main menus that can be used, namely Add Data, Update Data, Delete Data, View Data and Find Data.

With the database using the MySql DBMS. The output of this application is the Text Console
